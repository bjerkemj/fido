Todo:
* when a dog is (dis)liked, the photos for the next dog is not pre rendered. would be nice if 3-5 next dogs are always pre rendered. Sort of fixed, but need more time later
* affiliate links
* Create what is to be seen when the stack is empty of dogs
* Create some random function that gives you the next dog, so they don't come alphabetically
* add disclaimer, info might be wrong, do proper research online before commiting to purchasing
* x-button in dog info dog info to make it easier to return
* like logic can bug out due to fast likes. ask gpt what can go wrong and how to fix


Photos:
* remember to give credit to photographers and website (unsplash)
* Check all photos, and update where needed
* make better use of puppy photos
* 23 dogs are missing photos, fetch photos for them
* some dog photos are incorrect, wrongly cropped. go through manually and fix
