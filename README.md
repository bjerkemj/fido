Todo:
* when a dog is (dis)liked, the photos for the next dog is not pre rendered. would be nice if 3-5 next dogs are always pre rendered. Sort of fixed, but need more time later
* remember to give credit to photographers and website (unsplash)
* affiliate links
* Check all photos, and update where needed
* make better use of puppy photos
* 23 dogs are missing photos, fetch photos for them
* some dog photos are incorrect, wrongly cropped. go through manually and fix
* View more page could have more details added. (chips for temperament)
* Figure out what the temperaments mean, as well as the group and demeanor. add this to the site
* Create what is to be seen when the stack is empty of dogs
* Create some random function that gives you the next dog, so they don't come alphabetically
* add disclaimer, info might be wrong, do proper research online before commiting to purchasing
* Fix navbar, and decide for final design on it
* x-button in dog info dog info to make it easier to return
