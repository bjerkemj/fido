# Welcome to fido 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```

Todo:
* when a dog is (dis)liked, the photos for the next dog is not pre rendered. would be nice if 3-5 next dogs are always pre rendered. Sort of fixed, but need more time later
* create the view more section
* remember to give credit to photographers
* personal page with liked dogs
* affiliate links
* Check all photos, and update where needed
