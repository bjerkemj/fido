# Welcome to fido 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Todo:
* when a dog is (dis)liked, the photos for the next dog is not pre rendered. would be nice if 3-5 next dogs are always pre rendered. Sort of fixed, but need more time later
* remember to give credit to photographers
* personal page with liked dogs
* affiliate links
* Check all photos, and update where needed
* description seems to miss space between 2nd and 3rd sentence
* add view more to description
* make better use of puppy photos
* 23 dogs are missing photos, fetch photos for them
* some dog photos are incorrect, wrongly cropped. go through manually and fix
* icons (heart, measure, weight) are unused
* View more page could have more details added
